  - Responsible for the overall conduct of the society.
  - Willing to dedicate a lot of time.
- **Vice-President**:
  - Organises monthly STMUs and other miscellaneous events with our sponsors.

  > VP takes up about 4-5 hours most weeks, more depending on how much is going on. As well as organising STMUs, you're also expected to help out with other events that are going on, like programming competitions or smaller meetups. You'll need to take lots of initiatives, but this role can help you develop very useful transferrable skills like communication and time management!

- **Secretary**:
  - Responsible for the administration of the society
  - Publicising events by newsletters, social media etc
  - Writing minutes & preparing agendas for AGM, EGM, and weekly meetings
  - Society merch
  > I spent around 5-6 hours per week, scattered across the week - not including time attending CompSoc events, which on average should add another 2 (but they're great fun!) My main responsibilities are the admin work of a society: promoting society events, replying to emails and messages, keeping minutes, as well as keeping track of the committee overall. Some basic GitHub knowledge comes in handy, as we make pull requests on our website. It would also be ideal if you can handle both Facebook and Instagram pages.

- **2nd year, 3rd year, Final year, Postgraduate and Old Person representatives**
  - Responsible for communication between their years and the Society, and promotes events to their year.

  - Maintains technical services and in charge of technical setup for events.

  > I spent around 1-2 hours per week off-peak and 7-8 per week during rare peaks (event-related preparation). Some stuff I did this year was building websites for CompSoc cookbook and InfBall, and migrating BetterInformatics from Tardis to DigitalOcean! Lots of experience/fun, guaranteed. In other years, TechSecs have made Discord bots, HTB registration portals, etc. Some minimum required skills are basic unix/SSH, Git, experience with webservers, and basic front- and back-end web development, but you can always ask questions to past TechSecs if you don't know so don't worry :)

- **Social Secretary**:
  - Plans and organises our social events i.e. our pub nights, bowling, etc.
  - In charge of social media accounts!
  > In average, I spend about 1-2 hours each week planning the events. This includes emailing the venues, or going in person to the places to pay deposits or picking up items for the events. It also includes posting on social media about events and generally promoting the events. You might have an increase of work around freshers but apart from that the amount of hours is usually consistent.
