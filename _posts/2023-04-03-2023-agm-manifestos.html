<h2>Election Details</h2>
<p>
  Our AGM is happening tonight, at <time datetime="2023-04-03 18:00Z">18:00</time>! We'll first have a talk by Andrew representing Tardis, and after pizza we'll have speeches and voting!

<p>
    We also allow people to run on the night, if you did not have time to create manifestos. There are a few people who are running for positions, but aren't available for the AGM (primarily, they're studying abroad), so please read through the manifestos thoroughly!
