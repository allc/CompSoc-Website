    If you want to vote in the EGM, you need to <b><a href="/join" title="Click to go to the EUSA CompSoc membership page.">make sure you have CompSoc membership</a></b>.

  Election candidates - please remember the time limit for your speeches (1 minute for technical secretary, 3 minutes for treasurer). If you haven't gotten membership yet, <b>do that now</b>!
