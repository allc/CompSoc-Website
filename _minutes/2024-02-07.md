# Merch
Neil gave CompSoc the university supplier for merch (jswhoodiewear). We plan to contact them to make CompSoc merch. Not only hoodies, but quarter-zips, jackets, t-shirts, etc.

There are considerations to make informatics-related designs (not just CompSoc branding), as an alternative design.

Also, we plan to re-release CompSocks!

## Informatics Gin
Neil asked Fergus for a potential Informatics gin.
Ideas:
* Alan Turing - but he never went here
* Enigma Gin - sounds pretentious
* Appleton gin (with a sticker of Appleton tower)
# Santander bank account transfer
Charlotte Ausel, Vincentas Antanas Danys support the changes requested in the bank account making Elisa Sopie Fraticelli and Fergus White account holders of the CompSoc bank account.
