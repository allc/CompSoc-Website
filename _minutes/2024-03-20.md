# Meetings notes
## Constitutional Amendments:
The committee conducted a thorough review of the proposed changes to the Compsoc constitution, discussing each section in turn:

### Membership
Proposal: Add Clause - "All matriculated Informatics students are considered default Compsoc members unless they opt out."
Discussion:
- Could significantly boost reported membership
- Ensures all Informatics students are represented and covered by constitution
- May require changes to membership tracking and engagement reporting
Decision: Clause added

### Committee Oversight
Proposal: Add clause allowing executive officers to unilaterally issue warnings to underperforming committee members.
Discussion: 
- Concerns over potential for abuse due to vague criteria for "underperformance"
- Suggestions to require co-signing by another executive or allow appeals process
Decision: clause added.

### Quorum and Voting
Proposals: 
- Clarify that SIG leaders count towards quorum if present but are not required for quorum.
- Specify that no individual gets multiple votes even if holding multiple roles.
Discussion:
- Current wording ambiguous on SIG leader impact on quorum
- Low probability of one person holding enough roles to significantly alter outcomes
Decision: only elected committee roles are counted towards quorum, but SIG presidents can still vote.

### SIG Assets on Dissolution
Proposal: Add clause specifying SIG assets transfer to Compsoc if SIG dissolves, with allowance for exceptions by committee vote.
Discussion:
- Question of what currently happens to SIG assets and funds if SIG shuts down
- Some SIGs have valuable assets from independent grants that they don't want seized
- Acknowledgment that Compsoc technically owns all SIG assets as subgroups of Compsoc  
Decision: Each SIG dissolution should be addressed on a case-by-case basis. By default, SIG assets belong and must be returned to CompSoc, but exceptions may be granted.

### Legal Status
Proposal: Remove Clause 1.5.6 prohibiting Compsoc incorporating as an independent legal entity.
Discussion: Clause seen as redundant with existing requirements to operate under EUSA oversight.  
Decision: Clause removed unanimously.
